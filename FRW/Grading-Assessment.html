<h2>Assurance of Learning</h2>

<p>The Assurance of Learning Initiative, known as AoL, is the primary tool used to make sure that we at the Smith School are equipping our students with the skills, knowledge, and behaviors they need to be successful in their future careers.</p>

<h3>Curriculum Mapping</h3>
<p>Curriculum maps provide a comprehensive view of a student’s academic journey within a given degree program. These maps lay out the intended systematic and incremental competency growth of students as they complete each course. Benefits of utilizing and publishing curriculum maps include student empowerment, faculty collaboration, and improved institutional effectiveness. Curriculum mapping, in collaboration with deliberative dialogue, is an incredibly effective tool for redesigning an academic program from start to finish. </p>

<p>Curriculum mapping can answer the following questions: </p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>What key skills should our students demonstrate at a high level of mastery upon graduation? (You can also design a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/assessprogram/tools/masterygrid.html" target="_blank">mastery grid</a> to help answer that question)</li>
    <li>How will the program structure courses so that students progress from an introduction of key concepts to mastery of critical skills?</li>
    <li>What gaps or overlap exist in the curriculum? Are all competencies adequately addressed?</li>
    <li>Are students provided with adequate opportunities to learn, practice, and receive feedback relevant to key competencies?</li>
    <li>Do students have sufficient opportunities to apply their skills experientially in a variety of contexts and in a variety of ways?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Office of Transformational Learning (OTL) has templates for each of the academic programs. We also offer facilitation and support for programs or departments that wish to engage in an experiential process of creating a curriculum map.

<h2>Writing Effective Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Including effective learning objectives in your course design and syllabus simplifies assessment (and grading!) and clarifies to the students what skills they should have upon completion of the course. <strong>Aligning your assignments with specific learning objectives in your syllabus</strong> shows students how their assignments relate to the course goals, their expected skills, and simplifies grading and data reporting!</p>

<h2>Why Rubrics?</h2>

<p>Rubrics keep grading fair and equitable. They save faculty members time in grading, ensure consistency across sections where relevant, and clarify to students where in any given assignment they thrived or need to develop. Kansas State University provides an <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/assessment/toolkit/measurement/" target="_blank">excellent guide for designing your own rubrics</a> and OTL is happy to help with this process.

<h2>Grading Guides</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OWBDdlSWgYaHBU1KV67f03GQS_PR4Syv-Selm4Fcm0Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Diversifying assessment types</a> and measuring outcomes more than once after giving feedback ensures all students have a chance to show their strengths and develop.Ensure you include <a href="https://teaching.umd.edu/syllabus-language-and-course-planning" target="_blank">syllabus language</a> addressing expectations and grading! Rubrics are the best way to ensure fair grading, even for soft skills. However, it can be difficult to design rubrics and assessments that measure contribution and soft-skills in the class.. Below you’ll find some ideas for measuring these trickier elements of student learning.</p>
