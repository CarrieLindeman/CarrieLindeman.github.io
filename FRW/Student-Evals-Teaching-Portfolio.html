<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>

<p>Students are a rich source of ideas for improving a course, but often we can be left feeling unsure of what students mean in their course evaluations or how to respond to the information. One of the best ways to optimize your student feedback is to include a mis-course evaluation as This provides time to discuss feedback with your students and implement changes. In fact, research suggests that using mid-course evaluations is associated with more positive end-of-course evaluations.</p>
