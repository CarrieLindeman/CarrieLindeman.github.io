<p>At Smith, we share a common commitment to “doing the right things, the right way.” We want to communicate this value to our students, especially as it pertains to their academic performance. We need to clearly express our expectation that students will behave with integrity, and hold them accountable for violations. This doesn’t just benefit our students now – it will one day benefit their careers, corporations and communities.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Violations Protocol and How to Report It</h2>

<p>Crucially, if you already suspect a student, contact the office of student conduct and do not try to handle it yourself or use your discernment. Remember that any suspected incidences of academic integrity violations should <strong>not</strong> be discussed with the student or other faculty members.</p>

<p>Follow the following steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you have a suspicion, do not use your discernment, notify the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">The Office of Student Conduct</a> of any suspected violation using <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofMaryland&amp;layout_id=1">this form</a></li>
	<li>Do not grade an assignment suspected of academic dishonesty</li>
	<li>If you suspect a violation during an exam, do not prevent the student from completing the exam</li>
	<li>The outcome of the hearing process will let you know how to grade the assignment</li>
	<li>If the case occurs at the end of the semester and you need to post grades, using a “J” meaning judicial action pending or an “NG” (no grade) until the case has been resolved</li>
</ul>
