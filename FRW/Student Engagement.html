<h2>In-Class Techniques</h2>
<p>The following strategies can set the stage for an engaging class session:</p>

<h3>Classroom Set-Up</h3>
<p>Ensure the classroom is set up for interaction and that you can move around to the students or set them up into groups.</p>

</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Ice-Breakers</h3>
<p>Use an ice-breaker on the first day of class to set the tone of participation for the students. Ensure you hear every voice - use the roster to begin to learn names!</p>

<h3>Well-Paced Instruction</h3>
<p>Don't rush - students generally need a few moments before they answer and feel very nervous if instruction is rushed. Here are some techniques to slow down instruction.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>Facilitating a growth mindset by encouraging effort and contribution allows student to share more and attempt to answer questions they may be less certain about.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Addressing Technology</h3>
<p>It is crucial to have a technology policy in place for your class. Technology policies, clarify to students the specific rules and expectations in your course related to the use of laptops, computers, phones, or other mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>N.B. Students with ADS accommodations that include for laptop/tablet use must ALWAYS be permitted to use them regardless of the class policy.</strong></p>

</ul>

<h3>Group Work</h3>
<p>Adding Group-Work to class time is an excellent inclusive teaching practice that facilitates better discussions, improved retention, creative problem-solving skills, and increases collaboration and inclusion among students. Try adding it to one class session with the following techniques, your students will thank you!</p>

<h2>Experiential Learning</h2>
<p>Experiential Learning is a critical addition to all classes hoping to better prepare students for their work in the business world. Experiential learning provides opportunities for students to apply what their learning in your course to real-world problems.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Smith Live Cases</h3>
<p>One Experiential learning offering that is unique to Smith is the Smith Live Case.	Live Cases are opportunities within the curriculum for students to approach a business partner’s challenging problem and recommend a solution.	Each Live Case (primary, extended, or executive) is rigorous, unique, and exciting. In small groups, students work through the constraints and implications of the business situation. They develop recommendations based on the theories or strategies learned in class and present them to the Live Case partner. LiveCases are just one way that OTL’s Experiential Learning team assist faculty with incorporating and designing experiential learning activities into their instruction. </p>

<h3>Guest Speakers</h3>
<p>OTL can help coordinate guest speakers for your class. Even if you have partnerships in mind, OTL can handle the preparation of the event and provide some preparatory materials for speaker (facing a room of college students can be intimidating!) Guest speakers are a great way to introduce new voices to your instruction and bring concepts to life for your students by hearing professionals discuss the role they’ve played in their professional journey. Similarly, working through the types of problems they face in their profession is helpful to both the students and the speaker!</p>
