<h3>Engaging International Students</h3>

<p>Excellent Teaching for International Student is just Excellent Teaching! When teaching multicultural classes: make the implicit explicit, clarify expectations, and be transparent in your instruction. This addresses common challenges and supports better learning for international students (and domestic students too!) Remember that small things make a big difference e.g. even adjusting a rubric to allow points for bringing <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PoQ0EmwJgfFcwCDMznZNusXnpTM9flbZ9m9lxKN00rI" target="_blank">written assignments to UMD’s writing center</a>.
