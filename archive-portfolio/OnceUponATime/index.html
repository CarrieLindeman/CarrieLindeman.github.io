            Challenge 4 - Once Upon a Time
            
            The emotion I wanted to convey through my still art was that of adventure and wonder and I tried to continue that through the interactive update! I decided to make a story book page that had the same scene but during the day. This page seems safe and predictable. When the user clicks on the sun it reveals a moving and multi-dimensional version of that same scene. My reasoning for this interaction is that I wanted to emphasize the mystery of what really happened once upon a time. I think that the contrast of the safe story page and the interactive night makes the user questions their assumptions about what a traditional story can be. It also gives the user an immediate feeling of wonder because there is an element of transition, from day to night.
            My night interactions were all based on different paths the story could take. I gave the sword a looping glow fade tween and some magical particles as if the story was about the princess finding her destiny with this magical sword. I wanted this to entrance the viewer and make them mesmerized by the magic. The next interaction was the twinkling stars and drawing constellations. I made this with an adventure story in mind. I imagined that the princess had to navigate her way home by the stars and that her story would one day be immortalized in a constellation. I want the user to feel creative and hopeful when making their own constellations. I also added the dragon animation. This is based on a story where the princess must do the saving and defeat a vicious dragion. I wanted my user to feel fearful for the princess but excited for the adventure. I think that controlling the dragon's movements has sort of an ominous feeling when it comes to wondering what the princess will have to do with that magical sword in order to defeat him.
            I finally added sounds that I thought represented two different aspects of fairytales. We like fairytales because they are familiar and unintimidating, but when we are a kid, they are as exciting as any adventure. I wanted to capture that wonder and mystery in my interactive media experience.
